## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project deals with sensitive patient data and we do our very best to find security vulnerabilities and solve them as soon as possible,
We also aknowledge that our project is not perfect , since this is an open sourced initiative, I highly encourage you to go through this project and report any and all security issues you may find.  

In case you do find a vulnerability, please do NOT create an issue or mention the Vulnerability anywhere in the project, instead please send an email at `vichuhari100@gmail.com` with a detailed report and possibly the steps to reproduce the issue.
